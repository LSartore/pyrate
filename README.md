## Description:

PyR@TE is a python code that calculates the Renormalization Group Equations for any non supersymmetric model. After the gauge groups, the particle contents as well as the scalar potential have been defined in a model file, PyR@TE calculates the RGEs for the required parameters at the one- or two-loop level, and up to the three-loop level for gauge couplings.

### How to run PyR@TE

To run PyR@TE, open a shell, change to the directory where it is installed and enter:

python pyR@TE.py -m models/SM.model 

The option -m or --Model is used to read in a model file, in this case the SM.
