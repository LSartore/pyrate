## Description:

PyR@TE is a python code that calculates the Renormalization Group Equations (RGEs) for any renormalizable non-supersymmetric model. After the gauge groups, the particle contents as well as the scalar potential have been defined in a model file, PyR@TE calculates the RGEs for the required parameters at the one- or two-loop level, and up to the three-loop level for gauge couplings.

### How to run PyR@TE

While there is no official documentation available yet for the version 3, please refer yourself to the example notebook in `doc/` to see how to run PyR@TE.
